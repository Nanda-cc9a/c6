                <h2> retun banner yae miko </h2>
                <p>Genshin Impact leakers, on September 30, 2022, provided some crucial information on brand new banners that are expected to come out along with update 3.2. It seems that Childe and Yae Miko are set to return to the game along with that update after quite a long time.</p>

                   <p> Childe's return might not impress many, but Yae Miko has been a highly wanted character since the Dendro element was released. However, fans will have to save a lot of Primogems if they want to pull for her since Nahida, the Dendro Archon, is also expected to come out along with this update.</p>
                   <p>Yae Miko, on the other hand, did not appeal to the fans because her damage and gameplay were subpar despite being one of the most highly anticipated characters. However, both these units are now quite strong since Dendro has made Hydro and Electro extremely viable as elements.

                    Elemental reactions such as Aggravate, Bloom, and others are extremely strong, which has made both Childe and Yae Miko meta characters for the Spiral Abyss. Hence, players who did not pull for them will not be quite happy learning that they are coming back.
                    
                    However, fans should remember that these units will be released in the second half of Genshin Impact update 3.2. Instead, the first half will have the Dendro Archon, Nahida.
                    
                    Based on the initial leaks, Nahida is powerful and will be a powerful elemental damage amplifier and a Dendro applicator. So players who are meta-focused will have to pull for her. She will be an Archon, so that is something which enhances her popularity by several folds.
                    
                    Hence, Primogems will be of the essence, and players need to collect as much as possible to ensure they get all their favorite units with update 3.2.</p>
